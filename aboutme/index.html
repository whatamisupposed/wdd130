    <p>I love to paint, draw, and read. I may become a graphic designer. I like how BYU-I is more centered on Christ. I hope this class will help me on my way to become a graphic designer. I'm a lifelong member. I like a uote from Thomas Monson, "Prayer isn't just for times of trouble". I have a lot of favorite scriptures and quotes, but that's one of them.</p>
