      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Get people interested in art to otherplaces that would help them.</p>
      <!-- change this -->
  
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I am planning on having a website to help various people interested in art. There will be three pages; beginner, intermediate, and advanced. In those pages there will be links to websites or videos or supplies to help those levels. For instance, the beginner page will have links to videos about color theory, and links to beginner’s supplies, links to the art medium they want. The links will be to youtube videos, Drawspace, and other websites made specifically to help people with certain kinds of art. 
        Why will people come to your site?
        Lots of people like to draw and paint, but they dont know how or want to improve. The site will have links to youtube videos and other websites, lots of them. It will also have links to websites that have supplies, such as books and paint etc. There are lots of different styles with lots of different people’s teaching styles. 
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        Where to go to learn how to draw or paint. Where to get certain supplies. 
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        Research about art, which stuff they like best, etc.
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        What level of artist they are. What medium they like. I guess they could find out while scrolling through the website.
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        Because my site will have lots of different sources in the same place. It can be hard to find someone whose teaching style helps you, or good supplies etc. Different places/people teach different things in different ways, and I will hopefully have a lot of links. </p>
